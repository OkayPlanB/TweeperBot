# TweeperBot

This is a very simple bot that reads text from a file and posts a tweet, then removes the line from the file so it doesn't get posted again. This uses the Tweepy library for Twitter API intergration.
You will have to set up a developer account with Twitter to get the required keys to use this bot. Once your keys are added, you can use the dummyList file provided which has 50 random quotes simply for testing and demo, or you can edit the code to pull from your own text file.

This code is the barebones version of 2 Twitter bots currently running: https://twitter.com/RocketDiscourse and https://twitter.com/STSDerivedBot
